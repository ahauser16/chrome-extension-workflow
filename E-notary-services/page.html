      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <h4>my questions:</h4>
        <li> 1. provide an example of the "commercial software is available to notaries public to perform identify
          proofing and credential analysis." ?</li>
        <br />
        <li> 2. provide an example of “Papering out” which is a process by which the notary who performed an electronic
          notary service executes a paper certification (a certificate of authenticity) that a tangible copy of the
          signature page and document type of an electronic record remotely notarized by such notary public is an
          accurate copy of such electronic record.</li>
        <br />
        <li> 3. electronically notarized documents will be accepted by a county clerk or other government offices that
          <b>do not</b> have an electronic filing system through the “Papering out” process. The new law states, in
          part, <em>“[a] county clerk, city registrar, or other recording officer where applicable shall accept for
            recording <b>a tangible copy of an electronic record</b> and that is otherwise eligible to be recorded under
            the laws of this state <b>if the record has been certified by a notary public</b> or other individual
            authorized to perform a notarial act.”</em> New York Executive Law § 135-c(6)(d)(ii). To be accepted, the
          notary would first have to certify the electronically notarized document. New York Executive Law §
          135-c(6)(d)(i). <b>Please note, the new law does require a record to be “papered out” in order to be filed
          </b>and specific questions about filing such documents should be directed toward the filing office where the
          document will be submitted.
        </li> <br />

        <li>4. What is the difference between credential analysis and identify proofing?<br /><b>Credential analysis</b>
          validates the authenticity of the principal’s government-issued identification, and <b>identity proofing</b>
          validates the identity of the individual principal.</li> <br />

        <li>5. Journal Requirements (traditional):</li>
        <ul>
          <li>1. the date, approximate time, and type of notarial acts performed</li>
          <li>2. the name and address of any individuals for whom a notarial act was performed</li>
          <li>3. the number and type of notarial services provided</li>
          <li>4. the type of credential used to identify the principal, including, for verification made where a notary
            relies on the oath or affirmation of two witnesses who identify themselves with a valid government issued ID
            and who know the document signer personally, the names of the witnesses and, if applicable, the type of
            credential used; and</li>
          <li>5. the verification procedures used for any personal appearance before the notary public.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>6. Journal Requirements (electronic):</li>
        <ul>
          <li>1. the date, approximate time, and type of notarial acts performed</li>
          <li>2. the name and address of any individuals for whom a notarial act was performed</li>
          <li>3. the number and type of notarial services provided</li>
          <li>4. the type of credential used to identify the principal, including, for verification made where a notary
            relies on the oath or affirmation of two witnesses who identify themselves with a valid government issued ID
            and who know the document signer personally, the names of the witnesses and, if applicable, the type of
            credential used;</li>
          <li>5. the verification procedures used for any personal appearance before the notary public;</li>
          <li>6. for electronic notarial acts, identification of the communication technology, certification authority,
