  <h1>TAB-specific side panel</h1>
  <p>
    This side panel is available and stays open only on the current tab. For example, keep this panel open and click on
    another tab in your browser.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The panel should still be open with "E-Signature Notary Services" text in the dropdown menu but instead of seeing
    "TAB-specific side panel" you should see "Global side panel" and "This is a global side panel, which means it
    remains open on every tab."
