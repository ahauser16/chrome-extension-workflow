## Description

This project focuses on creating a Google Chrome extension specifically designed to enhance the functionality of Google Meet for the purpose of electronic document signing in compliance with the legal and technical requirements of the New York State Department of State (NYSDOS). The extension introduces a user interface that allows participants to upload identification documents and sign other documents electronically during live meetings. This added functionality is seamlessly integrated into the Google Meet experience, enabling users and notaries to view, sign, and validate documents in real-time. The signed documents are securely encrypted and transmitted to a backend server, where they are processed and subsequently emailed to both parties. The project utilizes React for the frontend development and Node.js for the backend, ensuring a robust and secure user experience that meets the specific legal standards set by the NYSDOS.  

### How is electronic notarization performed?

Electronic notarization is done by a registered electronic notary using commercially available software that complies with Department of State regulations.  To provide an electronic notarization, the notary public must be physically located within the State of New York at the time of the notarization.  The notary must identify the remote signer (also known as the “principal”) of the document through any of the following three methods:
- the notary’s personal knowledge of the signer;
- by means of communication technology that facilitates remote presentation by the signer of an official, acceptable form of ID, credential analysis, and identity proofing; or
- through oath or affirmation of a witness who personally knows the signer, and who is either personally known to the notary or identified by the previously referenced means of communication technology.

Commercial software is available to notaries public to perform identify proofing and credential analysis.

Regardless of the method used to confirm the identity of the signer, for electronic notarizations where the document signer appears remotely, the notary *must be able to see and interact, in real-time,* with the remote signer of the document through audio-visual communication technology.  Regardless of the location of the signer, this technology must have security protocols in place to prevent unauthorized access.  The notary must make and keep an audio-visual recording of the electronic notarization and ensure that there is a back-up of the recording. This recording must be kept for a minimum of 10 years.

After the signer has executed the document, it must be transmitted to the notary public for officiating.  This is done by presentation to the notary of the executed document through the software platform. The notary must confirm that the document is the same as the one signed electronically in the notary public’s presence before applying the notary stamp and signature to the document.  For electronic notarial acts performed remotely, the following statement must be added to the jurat “This electronic notarial act involved a remote online appearance involving the use of communication technology.”

The electronic notarial process does not require transmission of paper records or ink signatures of either the signer (i.e., principal) or electronic notary.  The result of the process is an electronically created, electronically stored document that may be done online, and may be papered out for recording or other purposes.

## Background
TLDR: Michael Markowitz's article [The Future Is Here](https://nysba.org/the-future-is-here-new-york-approves-remote-online-notarization/) is a good "primer" to the change in remote notarization law enacted in January 2023.

This section delves into the New York State Electronic Notary Commission, a recent initiative that this project aims to support. The content is structured as follows:
- **Introduction to Electronic Notarization:** An excerpt of "Frequently Asked Questions" from the [NYSDOS website](https://dos.ny.gov/notary-public) is included to familiarize readers with the electronic notarization process.
- **Legal Framework and Standards:** This part outlines the relevant **New York State Law** governing notarial acts, including electronic notarizations. Additionally, it references the Digital Identity Guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). While these guidelines are not laws per se, New York State Law incorporates several of their aspects. Notably, [Section 182.7 of 19 NYCRR](https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/public-notice-of-adoption_remote-notary.pdf) mandates the use of third-party software for credential analysis and identity proofing, aligning with the **Identity Assurance Level 2** standard defined in [NIST Special Publication 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines Doc 800-63-3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf).
- **Analyzing Identity Assurance Level 2:** This section provides an in-depth analysis of the Identity Assurance Level 2 requirements and other related standards. It concludes with key takeaways that are integral to the functionality of the Chrome extension being developed.

### NYSDOS FAQs

[NYSDOS - Remote Notarization FAQs](https://dos.ny.gov/notary-public) can provide a lamens terms primer to key aspects and challenges of the Electronic Notarization process.  
- **Changes in law**<br />
A new law, [NY Executive Law Section 135-c](https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/notary-public-license-law_01.2023.pdf), authorizes notaries to perform electronic notarial acts, provided they first register with the Department of State and comply with new rules for performing electronic notarizations.   On February 1, 2023, notaries wishing to provide electronic notary services will be able to register as an Electronic Notary with the Department of State.
- **What is an Electronic Notary?**<br />
Electronic notaries are notaries public who are registered to perform electronic notarial acts, which may be done remotely online. An electronic notary commission will authorize the license holder to provide both electronic remote online notarial services and traditional notary services.
- **What are Electronic notarial acts?**<br />
Electronic notarial acts are notarial acts performed using software to create an electronically generated and saved record. An electronic notarial act may be done remotely whereby the notary and the signer are physically separated but able to communicate with each other simultaneously by sight and sound using means authorized by the Secretary of State.  Those means are set forth in new regulations which are available here: [NY Executive Law Section 135-c](https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/notary-public-license-law_01.2023.pdf).

For electronic notarial acts performed remotely, the following statement must be added to the jurat “This electronic notarial act involved a remote online appearance involving the use of communication technology.”

    The electronic notarial process does not require transmission of paper records or ink signatures of either the signer (i.e., principal) or electronic notary.  The result of the process is an electronically created, electronically stored document that may be done online, and may be papered out for recording or other purposes.

- **What is “papering out?”**<br />
“Papering out” is a process by which the notary who performed an electronic notary service executes a paper certification (a certificate of authenticity) that a tangible copy of the signature page and document type of an electronic record remotely notarized by such notary public is an accurate copy of such electronic record.

- **Will electronically notarized documents be accepted by a county clerk or other government offices that do not have an electronic filing system?**<br />
Yes, paper copies of electronically notarized documents must be accepted through  the “papering out” process.  The new law states, in part, “[a] county clerk, city registrar, or other recording officer where applicable shall accept for recording **a tangible copy of an electronic record** and that is otherwise eligible to be recorded under the laws of this state **if the record has been certified by a notary public** or other individual authorized to perform a notarial act.” New York Executive Law § 135-c(6)(d)(ii). To be accepted, the notary would first have to certify the electronically notarized document.  New York Executive Law § 135-c(6)(d)(i).  Please note, the new law does require a record to be “papered out”  in order to be filed and specific questions about filing such documents should be directed toward the filing office where the document will be submitted.

- **What is credential analysis?**<br />
Credential analysis is a process where a third-party service validates a government-issued identification presented by an individual through a review of public and proprietary data sources.

- **What is identity proofing?**<br />
Identity proofing is a process or service through which a third party confirms the identity of a signer through review of personal information from public and proprietary data sources.

- **What is the difference between credential analysis and identify proofing?**<br />
Credential analysis validates the authenticity of the principal’s government-issued identification, and identity proofing validates the identity of the individual principal.

- **Does New York State require platform certification for Electronic Notarization Platform Providers?**<br />
  NYS does not require platform certification.  The model used here requires notaries to select platforms that comply with minimum standards. Notaries should obtain confirmation that any platform used complies with the NYS requirements and the platform provider is required by New York’s General Business Law to comply with those standards if they’re operating in the NY marketplace or if they’re representing to commissioned notaries that such platform complies.

- **Does the Department of State recommend a particular service provider**<br />
No, the Department does not recommend any particular provider, but the notary must use a provider that meets NYS requirements. If unsure, a notary should contact the service provider and obtain confirmation, from the provider, that their service complies with specific NYS requirements.

- **What are the requirements for an exemplar?**<br />
Exemplars are required for electronic notaries only. Your exemplar should include your electronic signature and seal as well as information about your digital credential service provider. Your electronic signature must be a digital version of your signature, typed signatures are not accepted. If you need assistance with your exemplar, please contact your service provider.

- **How do I submit an exemplar?**<br />
After you have been issued an electronic notary commission, please login to your NY Business Express Account and navigate to your dashboard. Select “Start Exemplar Application” to submit an exemplar. If you have more than one service provider, or if you change service providers, you may navigate here to submit or update your exemplar.

- **Are notaries required to keep a journal?**<br />
Yes. Beginning January 25th, 2023, all notaries, including those notaries that only provide traditional in-person services, are required to keep a journal of all notarial acts performed which includes the type of identification provided, for 10 years. Additionally, electronic notaries must maintain a journal of all notarial acts as well as an audio & video record of all electronic notarial acts performed.

- **What information must be maintained in the journal?**<br />

    “Traditional” notary journal must include:
  - (1)   the date, approximate time, and type of notarial acts performed
  - (2)   the name and address of any individuals for whom a notarial act was performed
  - (3)   the number and type of notarial services provided
  - (4)   the type of credential used to identify the principal, including, for verification made where a notary relies on the oath or affirmation of two witnesses who identify themselves with a valid government issued ID and who know the document signer personally, the names of the witnesses and, if applicable, the type of credential used; and
  - (5)   the verification procedures used for any personal appearance before the notary public.
  
  “Electronic” notary journal must include:
  - (1)   the date, approximate time, and type of notarial acts performed
  - (2)   the name and address of any individuals for whom a notarial act was performed
  - (3)   the number and type of notarial services provided

  - (6)   for electronic notarial acts, identification of the communication technology, certification authority, and verification providers used; and
  - (7)   an actual audio/video recording of the act.  

- **Does the law required that the signer physically be within NYS for electronic notarization?**<br />
No. The notary must be in NYS but the person using the services can be any place provided that if the person is not in the US, the following additional rule applies:
  - If the principal is located outside of the United States, the notary must verify, through verbal confirmation made by the signer in the course of the recorded electronic notarial act, that the record or subject of the notarial act:
    - (1) is to be filed with or relates to a matter before a public official or court, governmental entity, or other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; or
    - (2) involves property located in the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or involves a transaction substantially connected with the United States;
  - If an electronic notarization is done remotely, the jurat must expressly state that the person making the acknowledgement or making the oath appeared through use of communication technology.

- **How much can a notary charge for remote notarization?**<br />
  An Electronic Notary may charge up to **$25.00** per electronic notarial act performed. The fee may be charged for each notarial act performed during one electronic session. A certificate of authenticity for any document that has been created through an electronic notarial act is a notarial act for which **$2.00** may be charged.

NYS Law takeaways:
- A notary must use audio/visual technology such as Google Meet, Zoom, etc.
- methods for identifying document signers for an electronic notarization are the same as for a paper-based notarization, provided that the electronic notarial act is conducted utilizing communication technology shall meet the following standards:
  - the signal transmission is secure from interception
  - the notary public is able to communicate with the principal live, in real time 
  - the notary is able to communicate with and identify the remotely located individual at the time of the notarial act; 
  - a standard that requires two or more different processes for authenticating the identity of a remotely located individual utilizing technology to detect and deter fraud, but which may allow a notary public’s personal knowledge of a document signer to satisfy such requirement.
- an exemplar of the notary public’s electronic signature, which shall contain the notary public’s name and any necessary instructions or techniques that allow the notary public’s electronic signature to be read.
- a notary public must apply their electronic signature to a record in such a manner that such that removal or alteration is detectable and will render evidence of alteration of the document containing the notary signature which may invalidate the electronic notarial act.
- The notary public’s electronic signature is deemed to be reliable if the following requirements are met:
  - (i) it is unique to the notary public;
  - (ii) it is capable of independent verification;
  - (iii) it is retained under the notary public’s sole control;
  - (iv) attached to the electronic record; and
  - (v) linked to the data in such a manner that any subsequent alterations to the underlying document are detectable and may invalidate the electronic notarial act.
  - The remote online notarial certificate for an electronic notarial act shall state that the person making the acknowledgement or making the oath appeared through use of communication technology.
- In exercising powers pursuant to this article, a notary public, in addition to the venue of the act and signature of such notary public, shall print, typewrite, stamp, or affix by electronic means, beneath their signature in black ink, the notary public’s:
  -  **name**, 
  -  the words **“Notary Public State of New York,”** 
  -  the **name of the county** in which such notary public originally qualified, 
  -  and the **expiration date of such notary public’s commission** 
  -  the name of any county in which such notary public’s certificate of official character is filed, using the words “Certificate filed ................... County.”  
  -  A notary public who has qualified or who has filed a certificate of official character in the office of the clerk in a county or counties within the **City of New York** must also affix to each instrument such notary public’s official number or numbers in black ink, as assigned by the clerk or clerks of such county or counties at the time such notary qualified in such county or counties.
- NB-->a good feature would be to add "E-Stamps" that use the templates of Uniform forms of certificates of acknowledgment or proof within this state.
